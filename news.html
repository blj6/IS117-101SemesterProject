            <p class="news">The ongoing acquisition of prominent games publisher Activision Blizzard by tech conglomerate Microsoft is a perpetual topic of discussion in the industry, and more fuel is being added to the fire thanks to a new report. It's known that the United States' Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is investigating the impending deal, but new information suggests that a major antitrust lawsuit may be a possibility. According to the report at Politico, three sources familiar with the FTC's investigation of the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard deal believe the FTC could file an antitrust lawsuit as soon as next month. If the FTC were to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, it could challenge the deal and ultimately lead to it being abandoned. As of now, however, nothing is certain or guaranteed — and there's still more work to be done in the investigation.</p>

                <p class="news_2"> In a newly-published response to the CMA’s statement, Sony has expressed confidence that the regulator will conclude that the merger is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition and should therefore be blocked. The platform holder claims that if Microsoft were to gain sole control of Activision’s content, independent developers would all be harmed and Microsoft could increase prices for games, hardware and subscriptions. Sony goes on to argue that Call of Duty is “irreplaceable” and that Microsoft’s ownership of it would tip the balance of power so heavily in its favour that, ultimately, PlayStation might be unable to compete. </p>

                    <p class="news"> A rough time frame of when the Sony PlayStation 6 will be released has just been leaked. Discovered in documents from the United Kingdom's Competition Markets Authority as part of the ongoing Microsoft-Activision merger investigation, it appears the PS6 will either be coming out late 2027 or in 2028, giving the PS5 a rough life cycle of seven years. For those unfamiliar, this is part of an ongoing situation where Sony is attempting to prevent the $68.7 billion USD acquisition of Activision-Blizzard to Microsoft Xbox. While this will give Xbox titles like Overwatch, Diablo, and World of Warcraft, Sony's main concern is Call of Duty, where the game has such a large fan base that it could influence the mass switching of consoles. </p>

                    <p class="news"> God of War: Ragnarok is officially Sony's fastest-selling PlayStation exclusive. The company confirmed the news via Twitter, revealing that the sequel to the 2018 game sold a total of 5.1 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation title and setting a brand new record for the God of War franchise. Ragnarok dethrones The Last of Us II's record of 4 million in its three days, and leads Marvel's Spider-Man record of 3.3 million copies and God of War's 3.1 million copies. Ragnarok takes place three years after its 2018 predecessor and currently leads the nomination board for The 2022 Game Awards, receiving a total of 10 nods including Game of the Year. </p>
