                    <p class="card-text">Santa Monica did it once again. God of War Ragnarok offers us pretty much everything, relatable characters, the evolution of the combat that won us over in 2018, epic and stunning settings and a huge world to explore, with a guarantee of dozens of hours of gameplay and a set of characters of curious characterization, something that we know will be widely discussed. Until November 9, stay away from spoilers and enjoy, Ragnarok could be just around the corner.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Verdict:</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Gotham Knights is a lacklustre entry into the Batman mythos that feels like a major step back from what has come before. Whether it's the monotonous combat, subpar 30fps on console, lack of co-op incentives and strain it puts on the single-player experience or the fact that Gotham is dull and slow to explore, nothing justifies its existence. While its story might offer the occasional glimpse of something that could have been, it gives me no great pleasure in saying that Gotham Knights is my biggest disappointment of the year.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Verdict:</p>
                            <p class="card-text">It's been a long time coming, but finally the Dying Light sequel is here. The parkour is refined, the combat is great and the city is lively enough to keep you entertained for a long time. There is also plenty to do in the game, but at the same time it is mainly more of the same without really big innovative steps forward. The first few hours are also disappointing and the visual modes do not offer a best of both worlds standard. A fine sequel, but perhaps a victim of too high expectations.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">With deep characters, heaps of interesting narratives you can tackle as you like, constant gratifying upgrades, a stunning look and potentially the greatest sword combat in modern gaming, this is a Samurai adventure I couldn't get enough of, even if I had some niggles with the overall story and a few outdated design choices.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Verdict:</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Sifu will likely ignite the difficulty debate once again, and it's certainly a shame that more people won't get to experience the game because of the barrier for entry. There's design and mechanical justification for having such a steep learning curve, though, and it's part of what makes Sifu so compelling. Your journey from student to master is thrilling, mainly because it's governed by your own improving skill level rather than traditional character progression. There are memorable moments that stand out throughout, such as the boss fights and an enjoyable recreation of the iconic hallway scene from Oldboy, but it's Sifu's combat that shines through most brightly. For as unique and interesting as its aging mechanic is, it wouldn't work without the combat carrying the load and ensuring that each replay is just as engaging as the last. Is one life enough to know kung fu? Maybe not. But I would happily spend mine playing Sifu to find out.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Verdict:</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Here, exploration is everything. Elden Ring is an RPG but one which elevates role playing to the point of vérité. You are as much the stranger in a strange land as your avatar; basic controls and some mechanics are explained in what passes for the game's tutorial, but that’s about it. There’s no quest log, no icon-studded mini-map, no on-screen overlays or bread crumb trail telling you what to do next, or even where to go. Everything else must be learned, either decoded from oblique item descriptions in-game or gleaned from invaluable internet communities. Death is not so much a setback to be avoided as a necessary staging post on the path to enlightenment. It may sound daunting in theory but in practice it’s exhilarating. Every inch of progress in Elden Ring feels earned, and is thus infinitely more rewarding for it.</p>
